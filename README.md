# Churn-Reduction

In todayâ€™s age, competition is high in every sector of industry. Although, machine learning cannot always help in every sector but 
in some sectors it definitely can.

One of the problems faced by the companies is to find new customers, so companies always try to make good relationship with there customer because its more expensive to acquire a new customer than to keep their existing one from leaving. This problem can be alleviated if the companies can predict whether a person will remain the customer or will left, by looking at his past behavior, we hope to achieve this by building a classification model of machine learning.

Below is a description of project files:
